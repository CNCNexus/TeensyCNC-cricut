TeensyCNC, CNC controller using a Teensy 3.x!

Currently only 2 axis, but easily expanded.
Made to hack my Wife's Cricut Mini, because Provo Craft sucks and wants you to pay them to be creative.
I want to cut/draw what I want, not something that's in THEIR clipart library AND have to pay for it as well!!!

Besides that, it's also a fun project! :D
